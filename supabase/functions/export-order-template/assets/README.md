# Export Template Assets

This directory contains image assets used in order export templates.

## Logo Files

Place your supplier logo files in this directory with the following naming convention:

- **HPI Logo**: `hpi-logo.png`
- **Generic Logo** (optional): `generic-logo.png`

## Requirements

- Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG
- Recommended dimensions: 200x100 pixels (width x height)
- Maximum file size: 500KB
- The logo will be embedded in cells A1:B2 of the Excel export

## Adding a New Logo

1. Save your logo image in this directory
2. Name it according to the template (e.g., `hpi-logo.png`)
3. The logo will automatically be included in exports

## Notes

- If a logo file is not found, the export will still work and display placeholder text
- Logos are embedded directly into the Excel file for offline viewing
