The Plan
Step 1: Fetching Orders from Supabase
This step involves modifying the Orders component to retrieve order data directly from your Supabase database instead of the mock data.

Modify src/components/Orders.tsx:
Remove the import of orders from ../data/mockData.
Introduce a useState hook to manage the ordersList state, initialized as an empty array.
Introduce a useState hook for a loading indicator, e.g., isLoadingOrders, initialized to true.
Create an asynchronous function, fetchOrders, that will:
Set isLoadingOrders to true.
Use supabase.from('orders').select('*, supplier:suppliers(*), order_parts(*, part:parts(*))') to fetch orders. This query will perform joins to get related supplier and part details, aligning with your existing Order type structure.
Handle any potential errors during the fetch operation.
Map the fetched data to match your Order interface if there are naming differences (e.g., order_number from Supabase to orderNumber in your type).
Update the ordersList state with the fetched data.
Set isLoadingOrders to false.
Call fetchOrders inside a useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ([]) to ensure it runs once when the component mounts.
Update the getDisplayOrders function to use the ordersList state.
Modify the UI to display a loading indicator when isLoadingOrders is true.

Step 2: Creating an Order in Supabase
This step focuses on updating the CreateOrder component to insert new orders and their associated parts into your Supabase database.

Modify src/components/CreateOrder.tsx:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabase.
Update the handleSubmit function:
Set a loading state (e.g., isSubmitting) to true.
Construct the order object to be inserted into the orders table. Ensure that column names match your Supabase schema (e.g., orderNumber becomes order_number, supplier.id becomes supplier_id, createdBy becomes created_by).
Use supabase.from('orders').insert([orderObject]).select('id') to insert the main order. This will return the id of the newly created order.
If the order insertion is successful, iterate through formData.parts to prepare objects for insertion into the order_parts table. Each object should include the order_id (from the newly created order), part_id, quantity, and unit_price.
Use supabase.from('order_parts').insert(orderPartsArray) to insert all the order items.
Handle success and error scenarios.
After successful creation, call onOrderCreated (which in Orders.tsx will trigger a re-fetch of orders) and close the modal.
Set isSubmitting to false.
Remove any mock data functions related to adding parts to the global catalog, as parts should already exist in the database.

Step 3: Editing an Order in Supabase
This step involves updating the EditOrder component to modify existing orders and their parts in Supabase.

Modify src/components/EditOrder.tsx:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabase.
Update the handleSubmit function:
Set a loading state (e.g., isSubmitting) to true.
Construct the updatedOrderObject for the orders table, ensuring column names match Supabase.
Use supabase.from('orders').update(updatedOrderObject).eq('id', order.id) to update the main order details.
For order_parts updates:
First, delete all existing order_parts associated with this order.id using supabase.from('order_parts').delete().eq('order_id', order.id).
Then, insert the current formData.parts into the order_parts table, similar to the CreateOrder process.
Handle success and error scenarios.
After successful update, call onOrderUpdated (which in Orders.tsx will trigger a re-fetch of orders) and close the modal.
Set isSubmitting to false.
Adjust the initial formData population in the useEffect hook to correctly map Supabase data to your form state.
Step 4: Updating Order Status in Supabase
This step focuses on updating the StatusUpdateModal component to persist status changes to Supabase.

Modify src/components/StatusUpdateModal.tsx:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabase.
Update the handleSubmit function:
Set a loading state (e.g., isSubmitting) to true.
Construct an object with the status and notes (if provided) to update the orders table.
Use supabase.from('orders').update({ status: selectedStatus, notes: notes }).eq('id', order.id).
Handle success and error scenarios.
After successful update, call onStatusUpdate (which in Orders.tsx will trigger a re-fetch of orders) and close the modal.
Set isSubmitting to false.
Note: Your database schema includes a log_status_change trigger on the orders table, which will automatically insert a record into the status_updates table. You do not need to manually insert into status_updates from the client.
Step 5: Updating Pricing and Quotes in Supabase
This step involves updating the PricingUpdateModal component to reflect price changes in order_parts and record new entries in part_price_history, as well as storing quote attachments metadata.

Modify src/components/PricingUpdateModal.tsx:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabase.
Update the handleSubmit function:
Set a loading state (e.g., isSubmitting) to true.
Update order_parts: Iterate through updatedParts. For each part where the unitPrice has changed, use supabase.from('order_parts').update({ unit_price: newPrice, total_price: newPrice * quantity }).eq('id', orderPart.id).
Insert into part_price_history: Iterate through priceUpdates. For each PriceUpdate object, construct an object for the part_price_history table (e.g., part_id, price, supplier_name, effective_date, reason, created_by). Use supabase.from('part_price_history').insert(priceHistoryEntry).
Update orders total amount: The update_order_total trigger on order_parts should handle updating the total_amount in the orders table automatically.
Store Attachments Metadata: The orders table has an attachments column of type jsonb. You can store the attachments array (containing fileName, fileSize, etc.) directly in this column. Use supabase.from('orders').update({ attachments: attachmentsArray }).eq('id', order.id).
Handle success and error scenarios.
After successful update, call onPricingUpdate (which in Orders.tsx will trigger a re-fetch of orders) and close the modal.
Set isSubmitting to false.
Step 6: Updating Shipping Information in Supabase
This step updates the ShippingCostModal component to store shipping details in the orders table.

Modify src/components/ShippingCostModal.tsx:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabase.
Update the handleSubmit function:
Set a loading state (e.g., isSubmitting) to true.
Construct a shippingData object that matches the structure you want to store in the shipping_data jsonb column of the orders table. This object should include exchangeRate, shippingCostJPY, shippingCostAUD, totalWeightKg, totalVolumeM3, shippingMethod, estimatedDelivery, trackingNumber, notes, and partDetails.
Use supabase.from('orders').update({ shipping_data: shippingData, total_amount: getGrandTotalAUD() }).eq('id', order.id). You'll manually update total_amount here to include shipping costs, as this is a new calculation not covered by existing triggers.
Handle success and error scenarios.
After successful update, call onShippingUpdate (which in Orders.tsx will trigger a re-fetch of orders) and close the modal.
Set isSubmitting to false.
General Considerations for All Steps:

Error Handling: Implement robust try-catch blocks around all Supabase calls to gracefully handle network issues, permission errors, or data validation failures. Display user-friendly error messages.
Loading States: Use the isSubmitting or isLoading states to disable buttons and show spinners, preventing multiple submissions and providing visual feedback to the user.
User ID: For fields like created_by or updated_by, ensure you are correctly retrieving the authenticated user's ID from useAuth().user.id.
Data Refresh: After any successful CUD operation, ensure the main Orders list is refreshed to show the latest data. The onOrderCreated, onOrderUpdated, onStatusUpdate, onPricingUpdate, and onShippingUpdate callbacks should trigger a re-fetch in Orders.tsx.
This comprehensive plan will guide you through migrating your order management functionality to Supabase.
